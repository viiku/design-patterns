1. Real-world example

The Java Builder pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where object creation involves numerous parameters.

Imagine you are building a customizable sandwich at a deli. The Builder design pattern in this context would involve a 
SandwichBuilder that allows you to specify each component of the sandwich, such as the type of 
bread, meat, cheese, vegetables, and condiments. 
Instead of having to know how to construct the sandwich from scratch, you use the SandwichBuilder to add each desired 
component step-by-step, ensuring you get exactly the sandwich you want. This separation of construction from the final 
product representation ensures that the same construction process can yield different types of sandwiches based on the 
specified components.

2. A restaurant allows customers to customize burgers with various options like buns, patties, sauces, and toppings. The Builder Pattern can be used to construct different types of burgers.
