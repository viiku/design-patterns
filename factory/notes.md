### Factory Pattern
1. Encapsulation of Object Creation:
    Object creation logic is moved to a factory class, which decides which object to create based on input or conditions.

2. Polymorphism:
The factory returns objects of a common interface or abstract class, allowing the client to use the objects without worrying about their concrete implementation.

3. Static Factory Method:
A common implementation in Java uses a static method to create and return objects.
