1. Imagine a furniture company that uses the Abstract Factory pattern in Java to produce various styles
of furniture: modern, Victorian, and rustic. Each style includes products like chairs, tables, and sofas. 
To ensure consistency within each style, the company uses an Abstract Factory pattern.

In this scenario, the Abstract Factory is an interface for creating families of related furniture 
objects (chairs, tables, sofas). 
Each concrete factory (ModernFurnitureFactory, VictorianFurnitureFactory, RusticFurnitureFactory) implements the Abstract
Factory interface and creates a set of products that match the specific style. This way, clients can create a whole set of 
modern or Victorian furniture without worrying about the details of their instantiation. 
This maintains a consistent style and allows easy swapping of one style of furniture for another.
