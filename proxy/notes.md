### Proxy Pattern
**Controlling Object Access**

***In a real-world scenario, consider a security guard at a gated community. The security guard acts as a proxy for the residents. When a visitor arrives, the guard checks the visitor's credentials and permissions before allowing them access to the community. If the visitor is authorized, the guard grants entry; if not, entry is denied. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access the community, much like a Proxy design pattern controls access to a specific object.***

### When to Use the Proxy Pattern in Java
Proxy is applicable whenever there is a need for a more versatile or sophisticated reference to an object than a simple pointer. Here are several common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable. Typically, the proxy pattern is used to

Control access to another object
Lazy initialization
Implement logging
Facilitate network connection
Count references to an object
Provide a local representation for an object that is in a different address space.
