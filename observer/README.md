# Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**The subject and observers define the one-to-many relationship. We have one subject, who notifies many observers when something in the subject changes. The observers are dependent on the subject—when the subject’s state changes, the observers are notified.**
