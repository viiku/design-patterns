The weather station will be based on our patent pending WeatherData object, 
which tracks current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure). 
We’d like you to create an application that initially provides three display elements: 
current conditions, weather statistics, and a simple forecast, 
all updated in real time as the WeatherData object acquires the most recent measurements. 
Further, this is an expandable weather station. Weather-ORama wants to allow other developers to write their own
weather displays and plug them right in. So it’s important that new displays will be easy to add in the future.
Weather-O-Rama thinks we have a great business model: once the customers are hooked, we intend to charge them for each display they use. Now for the best part: we are going to pay you in stock options.
