1. Creating a Duck game implementing startegy design.
2. Dragon uses diferent techniques using startegy pattern to slay 

3. What is the main purpose of the Strategy pattern and when should you use it?"
        Tests understanding of core pattern benefits
        Should mention behavior encapsulation and runtime flexibility

4. How does Strategy pattern differ from inheritance for implementing different behaviors?"
        Tests understanding of composition vs inheritance
        Should discuss flexibility and avoiding class explosion

5. In this code snippet, a payment system uses different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer). 
    How would you implement this using the Strategy pattern?"
        Tests practical application skills
        Should show interface creation and concrete strategies

6. Implement a TextFormatter class that formats text differently (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, title case) using the Strategy Pattern.


7. Design a SortingContext class that can use different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort) at runtime.
