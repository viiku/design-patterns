Real-world example

In a real-world example, consider a company with a complex organizational structure. The company consists of various 
departments, each of which can contain sub-departments, and ultimately individual employees. The Composite Design Pattern 
can be used to represent this structure. Each department and employee are treated as a node in a tree structure, where 
departments can contain other departments or employees, but employees are leaf nodes with no children. This allows the 
company to perform operations uniformly, such as calculating total salaries or printing the organizational chart, by 
treating individual employees and entire departments in the same way.
