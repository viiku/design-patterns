# Composite Pattern
The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern used to represent a group of objects as a single object. It allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful when working with tree-like structures, such as file systems, organizational hierarchies, or graphical scene hierarchies.

### Key Concepts
1. Component: An abstract class or interface that defines the common behavior for both individual objects and composites.
2. Leaf: A concrete class representing individual objects that do not have child objects.
3. Composite: A concrete class representing a group of Component objects. It can hold child components (both leaves and other composites).

### When to Use the Composite Pattern?
When you have a tree-like structure of objects.
When you want to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
When you need to perform operations on a group of objects without worrying about whether they are individual objects or composites.
